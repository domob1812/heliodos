# Heliodos

Heliodos is an augmented reality (AR) Android application that overlays the sun's trajectory onto a live camera feed. It displays the sun's path at the solstices, equinox, and the current time.

This visualization is particularly useful for planning in gardening or real estate, helping you understand sunlight exposure throughout the year.

## Features

*   **AR Sun Trajectories**: View the sun's path for key dates (solstices, equinox) and the current time overlaid on the real world.
*   **Camera Selection**: Pinch to zoom to iterate through available physical back cameras (e.g., wide angle, normal, telephoto).
*   **Settings & About**: Tap on the screen to open the about dialog and access settings.
